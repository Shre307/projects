            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is not how well you can read and write but whether you can communicate with and understand the world around you. A good education not only teaches you skills but also helps you broaden your horizons, gain better perspective, and
                teaches you to think for yourself. People today are quite aware and comfortable speaking about social injustices and other pressing issues. This can be attributed to the increased access to education around the world, which in turn has
                made society more accepting and open-minded. Therefore, education is an element of human evolution. The importance of education is also pronounced in areas of creativity and innovation. Education encourages thinking outside the box and
                experimenting with new ideas.</p>

                reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends
                a lot of Education</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various
                researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of
                the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural
                heritage from one generation to the next.</p>
